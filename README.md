<h2>Push Swap</h2>

Push Swap is a 42 School project that challenges students to sort a stack of numbers using a set of predefined operations. The goal is to implement an efficient algorithm to minimize the number of moves required to sort the stack. This project focuses on algorithmic problem-solving and the understanding of stack manipulation.
